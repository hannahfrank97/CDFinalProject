# Storyline

## Gen Z Horror (PC edition)

You wake up in a messy room and realize you have an urgent dental appointment. To make things worse, your phone is buried under the clutter, and you must first find it to call your dentist. Once you locate your phone, you must navigate through a phone call, choosing the right options to maintain your karma points, which will determine if you can successfully schedule your appointment.

But that's not all! Your day gets even more challenging when you have to bring a beer to your racist uncle. After finding the beer, you must survive a conversation with him, making wise dialogue choices to keep the karma points balanced and end the conversation positively.
